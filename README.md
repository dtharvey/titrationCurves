# Functions for Generating and Plotting Titration Curves

Gathered here are functions for generating and plotting normal, first derivative, and second derivative titration curves for acid-base titrations, complexation titrations, redox titrations, and precipitation titrations.

All functions use the general approach outlined in _Principles of Quantitative Chemical Analysis_ by Robert de Levie (McGraw-Hill, 1997) in which a single master equation is used to calculate the progress of a titration. See the file Titration_Curves.pdf  for a more detailed description.
